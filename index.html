                    My name is Kayla Sullens, and I am a Math Educator turned Software Developer. 
                    I have been married for almost 10 years, and we have a 5-year-old daughter and 
                    a 9-year-old Boxer dog. I live in Southern California, and I have been working
                    remote for 5 years now. 
                    While I have loved teaching Math in different capacities over the last 10 years, 
                    it's time for me to make a change. My best days have been those at my computer
                    creating things, and I want to have more of those days. I was always fascinated 
                    by software development and coding, but never thought I was smart enough to do it.
                    Now, I have the confidence to know that I can do hard things and I'm excited to 
                    switch careers and learn a lot of new things.
