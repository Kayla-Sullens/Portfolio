            <p>
                My name is Kayla Sullens, and I am a Math Educator turned Software Developer.
                I have been married for almost 10 years, and we have a 5-year-old daughter and
                a 9-year-old Boxer dog. I live in Southern California, and I have been working
                remote for 5 years now.
                While I have loved teaching Math in different capacities over the last 10 years,
                it's time for me to make a change. My best days have been those at my computer
                creating things, and I want to have more of those days. I was always fascinated
                by software development and coding, but never thought I was smart enough to do it.
                Now, I have the confidence to know that I can do hard things and I'm excited to
                switch careers and learn a lot of new things.

                    <h3>Project 1 - Marvel Character Directory</h3>
                    <p> 
                        This project was completed as a group, with my group members being Jaime Quezada and Ignaacio Gamez. We used two different APIs to pull data for a Marvel character that a user would search for.Once a character name is entered in the search bar, the name, image, description, and powers of the character are displayed.
