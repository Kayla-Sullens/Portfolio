# Porfolio

## Description

This challenge assignment was completed to showcase advanced CSS skills by creating a portfolio from scratch. I had to do the html code and css styling, with the freedom to make my page mine. This webpage needed to function as the example did, with the navigation links making the UI scroll to the proper section. I also made the navigation links change colors when hovered over because I think it looks nice. I also had to follow some other guidelines in terms of the first project image being larger than the rest, and showing that I know how to use the hover property and having the clicked image take the user to the deployed page. That was the most challenging part, only because I didn't want to deploy the first assignment since it was refractoring code and not doing things solely on my own. I overcame that challenge by deploying my mini project from this module, a CSS snippet cheatsheet.
